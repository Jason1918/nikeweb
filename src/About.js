In 1964, Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, fueled by a passion for improving athletic performance, embarked on a journey to revolutionize the footwear industry.  They envisioned a world where athletes of all levels had access to innovative products that would help them achieve their full potential.

With the now-iconic Waffle Trainer, crafted using Bill Bowerman's wife's waffle iron,  Nike (officially established in 1971) was born.  Starting out in a small storefront near Beaverton, Oregon, they were driven by a commitment to pushing the boundaries of design and performance.  From those early days, Nike has grown into the world's leading sports brand, constantly innovating and expanding its product line from footwear to apparel, equipment, and experiences.

Today, Nike stands as a leader in global sportswear.  They offer a diverse range of athletic products that empower athletes of all levels to achieve their best.  Their commitment to "Just Do It" remains at the heart of everything they do. We believe in breaking barriers and inspiring people to push their limits, evident in their support of world-class athletes and grassroots programs alike.

As they look towards the future, Nike is excited to continue developing cutting-edge technologies and fostering a culture of innovation that will inspire future generations of athletes.  They are grateful for the continued support of their customers, employees, and partners who share their vision for a healthier, more active world.</p> </div>
